Perhaps you've never made a pull request before, or you've used git a little but never collaboratively? Have a look through the [open source guide to submitting contributions](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution) to give you a good idea of how things work.

Some of our issues are marked first-timers-only - these are issues that may be relatively straightforward, where we'll happily walk you through steps you're unsure about. (psst, you can also [search GitHub for all issues marked with this label](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=first-timers-only+label%3Afirst-timers-only+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=), not just InterMine).
