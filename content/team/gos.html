    <p>InterMine is part of the Micklem Lab, led by Gos Micklem. Gos is also director of the <a href="http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Computational Biology Institute</a>. Gos can often be found writing grants and winning <a href="https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Genetics</a> awards for enthusiastic lecturing. (He says that this was probably a statistical anomaly).</p>
