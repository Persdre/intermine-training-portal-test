}

InterMine developer calls are held roughly once a month, on the first tuesday of the month, generally at 17:00 UK time (with occasional time shifts around daylight savings clock changes). These calls are generally techie-oriented and consist of topics such as:

- Upcoming technical updates to InterMine.
- Discussions regarding the InterMine data model.
- General updates, e.g. upcoming training events, Google Summer of Code, conferences.

The call is open to anyone, but developers and InterMine admins are especially encouraged to attend. Calls are shown on the [InterMine Calendar](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/events/), and agendas with joining instructions are sent to the [developer mailing list](https://lists.intermine.org/mailman/listinfo/dev) before every call.
